# 📝 Todo List Application Guide

## 📘 Problem Statement

Develop a dynamic Todo List application that enables users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application should allow users to:

- Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed
- Filter tasks based on their status
- Persist data across sessions using localStorage

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement core functionalities: add, edit, delete, and complete tasks
- Enable filtering of tasks: All, Active, Completed
- Persist tasks using localStorage
- Ensure input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Provide a responsive and user-friendly interface

## 🧑‍💻 User Stories

1. **Add Task**: As a user, I want to add new tasks so that I can keep track of what I need to do.
2. **Edit Task**: As a user, I want to edit existing tasks in case I need to update the task details.
3. **Delete Task**: As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant.
4. **Complete Task**: As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed to track my progress.
5. **Filter Tasks**: As a user, I want to filter tasks to view all, active, or completed tasks.
6. **Persist Tasks**: As a user, I want my tasks to be saved so that they remain after refreshing or reopening the browser.
7. **Prevent XSS**: As a user, I want the application to be secure and prevent malicious inputs.

## 🛠️ Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task by entering text and clicking the "Add" button
- **Edit Task**: Users can edit an existing task's text
- **Delete Task**: Users can remove a task from the list
- **Complete Task**: Users can mark a task as completed, visually indicating its status
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter the task list to show all, active, or completed tasks
- **Clear Completed**: Users can remove all completed tasks at once
- **Persist Tasks**: Tasks are saved in localStorage and loaded upon application start
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Responsive Design**: The application should be usable on various devices and screen sizes
- **Performance**: The application should handle a reasonable number of tasks without performance degradation
- **Accessibility**: The application should be accessible to users with disabilities

## 🧪 Testing

To ensure the application functions correctly, the following test cases should be implemented using Jest:

1. **Add Task**: Verify that a new task is added to the list
2. **Edit Task**: Verify that editing a task updates its text
3. **Delete Task**: Verify that a task is removed from the list
4. **Complete Task**: Verify that marking a task as completed updates its status
5. **Filter Tasks**: Verify that filtering displays the correct subset of tasks
6. **Clear Completed**: Verify that all completed tasks are removed
7. **Persist Tasks**: Verify that tasks are saved and loaded from localStorage
8. **Input Sanitization**: Verify that inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS
